# Security Policy

## Reporting a Vulnerability

At Ragrank, we take security vulnerabilities seriously. If you discover a security issue within the Ragrank project, please report it to us immediately. We appreciate your efforts in disclosing the vulnerability responsibly and will work to address it promptly.

To report a security vulnerability, please follow these steps:

1. **Privately Notify Us**: Send an email to [security@ragrank.com](mailto:izamdeveloper1@gmail.com) with details about the vulnerability. Please do not disclose the issue publicly until it has been resolved.

2. **Provide Details**: Include as much information as possible about the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce it and any potential impact.

3. **Coordinate Disclosure**: We will acknowledge your report within 24 hours and work with you to address the vulnerability. Once a fix is available, we will coordinate the disclosure of the issue.

## Responsible Disclosure Guidelines

When reporting security vulnerabilities, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- **Do Not Exploit**: Do not attempt to exploit the vulnerability or access data beyond what is necessary to demonstrate the issue.

- **Privately Notify**: Report the vulnerability to us privately, rather than disclosing it publicly or to third parties.

- **Provide Details**: Include sufficient details to reproduce the vulnerability, including any relevant code snippets, screenshots, or logs.

- **Be Patient**: Allow us time to assess and address the vulnerability. We will keep you informed of our progress throughout the process.

## Bug Bounty Program

Currently, we do not have a bug bounty program in place. However, we greatly appreciate and acknowledge the efforts of security researchers who responsibly disclose vulnerabilities to us.

> Thank you for helping us keep Ragrank safe and secure for all users.
