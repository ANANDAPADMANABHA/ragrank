**A Bit History**

- At the 2017 NeurIPS conference, Google researchers introduced the transformer architecture in their landmark paper ["Attention Is All You Need"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_Is_All_You_Need).
- The following year in 2018, [BERT](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/BERT_(language_model)) was introduced and quickly became famous in the tech world.
- Although decoder-only GPT-1 was introduced in 2018, it was GPT-2 in 2019 that caught widespread attention. After that they released GPT-3 and GPT-4.
- Since 2022, source-available models have been gaining popularity, especially at first with BLOOM and LLaMA, though both have restrictions on the field of use. 
- Througout the time, LLM have a lot of issues such as [Hallucination](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hallucination_(artificial_intelligence)), Low quality response and many more. That's when The RAG models, LLM observability and monitoring came into the picture.

Understand the importance of evaluation and monitoring of the [LLM](./llm.md) and [RAG](./rag_model.md).
