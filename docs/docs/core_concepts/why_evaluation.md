# Why Evaluation

Evaluation is the only way to improve the performance of a system. In RAG is it crucial to improve the system with the help of predefined evaluation metrics

Here are some of the reasons
- tells us  how well the RAG model does the thing it was designed to do.
- It doesn't just give you a 'good' or 'bad' verdict. It pinpoints specific problems:
    - **Retrieval**: Is the model finding the right information? Are there errors in how it searches the knowledge source?
    - **Generation**: Is the output factually correct? Does it make sense? Is it free of grammatical errors, and is it relevant to the original query?
- With clear indicators of what's working and what's not, you can refine the RAG model
- allows you to compare them objectively, choosing the best one for your specific application.
