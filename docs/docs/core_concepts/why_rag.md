# What is RAG

RAG stands for Retrieval-Augmented Generation. Let's break it down:

- **Retrieval**: Imagine a super-smart search engine that can find specific bits of information from a massive library of knowledge.
- **Generation**: Think of a creative writer who can take information and put it together in a clear and interesting way.\

A RAG model combines these two powers:

- **It searches**: Much like a librarian finding the right book, it locates relevant information within a huge database (like Wikipedia, scientific papers, or even company documents).
- **It creates**: Similar to a writer, it uses this retrieved information to generate new text, like answers to your questions or summaries of complex topics.
