# ðŸ§© Metrics

These metrics help us figure out if computer-generated answers make sense and fit the conversation. They also help us see where programs do well and where they need improvement.

With Ragrank, we have a wide range of metrics to choose from, covering things like how words fit together and if the meaning is correct. This helps us make sure our language programs work as best as they can.
There are a lot of metrics available in Ragrank. They are classified into this

- [Response related](./response_related/index.md)
- [Context related](./context_related/index.md)
- [Custom metrics](./custom_metrics/index.md)

Feel free to check out all !

```{Warning}
The metrics in Ragrank are still under development and research. If you find any errors while scoring, please raise an [issue on GitHub](https://github.com/Auto-Playground/ragrank/issues). We're actively working to improve them. Kindly keep this in mind !
