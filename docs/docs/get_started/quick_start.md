# Quick Start 

🚀 Get started with the following command:

```bash
pip install -U ragrank
```

If you’re planning to contribute and make modifications to the code 🥹, install from the source

```{important}
This library is using [Poetry](https://github.com/python-poetry/poetry) for dependency management and packaging. If `poetry` is not installed in your system, please refer this [installation guide](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) and install the `poetry` 😊.
```

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Auto-Playground/ragrank.git
cd ragrank
poetry install
```

Now you can do the [evaluation](basic_evaluation.md) on your own. 



```{admonition} A secret story ...
:class: Caution

Not long ago, a guy found an error in this library while 
reading the documentation. He immediately raised an issue
on the [ragrank github page](https://github.com/Auto-Playground/ragrank). 
Now, he is a contributor to the ragrank library. 
Now you understood the beauty of Open Source ❤️‍🔥.
