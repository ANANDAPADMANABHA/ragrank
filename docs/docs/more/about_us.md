# About Us

- Welcome to Ragrank, where we're all about making machine learning easier for everyone.

- At Ragrank, our goal is simple: to help people who work with computers understand their AI systems and suggestion programs better.

- We started Ragrank because we wanted to make it easier for others to see how well their programs are doing. We've put a lot of effort into making Ragrank, carefully designing each part to be as helpful as possible.

- But Ragrank is more than just a tool. It's a reflection of our values and what we believe in. It's about working hard, staying positive, and always trying to make things better.

- As you check out Ragrank, we hope you'll join us on our journey. 

Thanks for being a part of our adventure!

From,
The **Ragrank Team**
